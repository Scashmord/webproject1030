    <h1>My Favorite Video-Games</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>I have been playing video games for almost my entire life, obviously this
        means I have finished a game or two. I wanted to make this list for class,
        but also because I thought it would be fun to round up some of my favorites
        and make a table and list providing information about them.
    </p>

    <h2>Why do I play video-games?</h2>

    <p>Playing video games has always allowed for me to enter different worlds and 
        experience the worlds that they provide. When I came home from school as a kid
        you could either find me with a book in front of my face or a controller in 
        my hand. It was also a way for me and my family to bond together, as we all liked
        playing games together. Some of my favorite memories are from when I was playing
        <a href="https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Call_of_Duty:_Black_Ops_II" title="Call of Duty Black Ops 2 Fan wikipedia page">Call of Duty</a> with my siblings and my dad, trash talking each other and getting 
        mad when we all inevitably lost to my older brother. 
    </p>

    <h3>Here are my favorite games and why they are listed. Below that are the details
        of each game and a description about them written by me </h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Outer Wilds: Shaped my world view and is one of the only games to this day to make me cry.
            I bought the physcial vinyl record and still play it often, even after 3 years. </li> 
        <li> Minecraft: I have the most hours in this game over every other game out there. Most of the hours
            were spent with my brother, and are some of my fondest memories I have. </li>
        <li> Halo 3: This game, and Halo series in general, shaped my entire life of gaming sessions and mindset. The first
            game came out the year I was born and the last game came out 4 years ago with more on the way.
            Me, my brothers, and almost every single one of my friends would spend countless hours
            in the world creator, building bases and race tracks to compete against each other with.
            For nostalgia,this game and Halo Reach are unmatched besides Minecraft.
        </li>
        <li> Cyberpunk 2077: This game is the reason I have such a powerful PC. When it came out almost nobody
            could run it, especially my potato laptop.  I started saving money for 2 years before buying my
            current pc, making sure it had the proper specs allocated in order to play this beast of a game.
            The diversity of the builds you can make create entirely different play styles each time you
            play through a game. I was an ultra-fast assassin who could slow down time and it felt so amazing to play.  </li>
        <li>Titanfall 2: How could you not love a game about parkour, guns, and massive mechs you can control paired
            with a beautiful singleplayer story. Not to mention the fact that I put hundreds of hours into the
            multiplayer with my Xbox friends, keeping us connected even when I went away to my first college.
        </li>
    </ol>
